### About Karma

Karma - a test runner that fits all our needs. It is a tool that enables the running of source code (i.e. JavaScript) against real browsers via the CLI. The fact that it runs against real browsers rather than “fakes” with a virtual DOM is extremely powerful. DOM implementations vary across browsers therefore the idea is to use the actual browsers for correctness.
